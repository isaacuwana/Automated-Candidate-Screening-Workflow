## Solution Architecture

### Professional Implementation Approach
Instead of using n8n or Zapier, I developed a **production-ready Python solution** that provides:

- **Superior Flexibility**: Custom logic for complex keyword matching
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and logging
- **Enhanced Security**: Secure credential management and data protection
- **Professional Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and performance metrics
- **Scalability**: Designed for growth and high-volume processing
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with comprehensive documentation

### Core Workflow Components

    C --> D[Send Response]
    D --> E[Log & Monitor]
```

1. **Email Processing Service** - Monitors `careers-new-applicants@yourcompany.com`
2. **Keyword Screening Engine** - Analyzes for "Mid-level", "Python", "GenAI"
3. **Google Sheets Integration** - Updates "Candidate Tracker" and "Rejected Applications"
4. **Communication System** - Sends personalized responses with Calendly links
5. **Monitoring & Logging** - Comprehensive health checks and performance tracking
